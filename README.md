coinbase-node-demo
=========

Written to demonstrate the coinbase-node Node.js package.

In the process of creating the demo I tried to get caught up on node web development so I use some libraries and tools here that make the system too complicated to be a good reference use of the API.  But regardless, it all works for me and I learned a lot.

The demo uses the following build tools and libraries:

* gulp
* react.js
* expressjs
* jade
* sass
* bootstrap
* connect-redis
* intern
* travis-ci
* docker

and of coarse coinbase-node.
